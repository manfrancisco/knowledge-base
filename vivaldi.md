# Installing Vivaldi

## Ubuntu
It appears that Vivaldi does not currently provide a PPA, so the best way to install it is just by
downloading the DEB.

### Install the DEB
Depending on the flavor of Ubuntu, you may be able to just open the file and press `Install`.
If not, navigate to the download location and install it with:

```
sudo dpkg -i vivaldi-stable_<version>_<arch>.deb
```
